title: Debugging Turborepo
description: How to debug Turborepo
---

As with most tools, it can sometimes be frustrating to understand why Turborepo
is not working the way you expect. This page covers some tools to debug when
using the `turbo` CLI.

## Enable Verbose Logs

THe best debugging tool we have as developers are logs. You can turn up the log
level with the [`--verbosity`][1] flag. Combined with [building from
source][3], this can be a powerful and flexible way to see what's going on under
the hood.

## Check your Configuration

### Task Configuration

You can [get started][7] with Turborepo with minimal configuration -- that's one
of the things people love about Turborepo! But when you omit configuration,
Turborepo internally uses a default value. Additionally, when using
[Workspace Configurations][8] in a monorepo, it can be confusing to understand
how Turborepo interpreted your `turbo.json`. You can use the `--dry` or `--dry=json` to
get a "resolved" task configuration for any task. For example:

```bash
turbo run build --dry=json
```

Look for a `resolvedTaskConfiguration` key in the output!

### User Config

When you link your repository to Vercel, Turborepo stores configuration in two places:

- your Vercel team information is stored in `.turbo/config.json`. You can
  inspect this file to see what else might be in there!
- an authentication token is stored in
  `~/Library/Application\ Support/turborepo/config.json`.

## Inspect the Cache

When turborepo runs a task that has configured `outputs`, it caches those outputs, along with the
logs from that task in the `node_modules/.cache/turbo/`. These artifacts are compressed with `tar`,
but you can uncompress and see what's in them. On macOS or Linux, you can use:

**TODO**: use `Tab` and add Windows command for this.

```bash
tar -tf node_modules/.cache/turbo/01e9ab3a3790f93a.tar.zst
```

## Build from Source

One of the advantages of JavaScript codebases are that you can open up
`node_modules/` and edit the code you're running inline. This is not possible
with `turbo`, because the runnable code is a compiled binary and you cannot edit
it inline. But because the codebase is Open Source, you can always get
[the source code], modify it, and build it locally. The bulk of this
documentation is available in the [Contributing Guide][4], but you can use those
directions even if you aren't planning to make a contribution.

1. [Clone the git repo][5] from [`vercel/turbo`][6]
1. `cd cli`
1. Make any changed (for example add logging statements with `fmt.Println()`)
1. Run `make`
1. In your project, use `/:path/:to/:turbo/target/debug/turbo` instead of global
   turbo or the version of `turbo` installed in your project.

## Common Pitfalls

### `.turbo`

One of the [core concepts][2] behind Turbo is that when a declared input
changes, it invalidates any caches for that task. As part of running that task,
Turborepo creates the following directories:

**TODO** do tabs here for Windows-based paths

- `.turbo/` at the root of your repo
- If you're using a monorepo, a `.turbo` directory in each workspace (e.g.
  `apps/my-app/.turbo/`)
- `node_modules/.cache/turbo/`

Becuase the first two directories are not git-ignored by default, you may see an issue where
you run the same task twice and not get a cache hit, because the `.turbo` directories are getting
included as the task _inputs_, invalidating cache. To avoid this problem, you can limit your `inputs`
configuration, or add `.turbo/` to your `.gitignore` file. We recommend the latter.
